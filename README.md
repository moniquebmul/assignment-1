Pitch:
This piece would focus on the changes in educational achievement in the NYC Metro Area from 2009 to 2019, which shows that educational achievement has increased. This data was obtained from Social Explorer which used data from the American Community Survey for 2015-2019 5-year estimates and 2005-2009 5-year estimates. The infographic would use a horizontal bar chart to show the differences in each level of educational achievement for 2009 and 2019. The two years would be represented by different colored bars. Next to the word for each level of educational achievement would be an icon representing it.
