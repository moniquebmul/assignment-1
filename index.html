<h4><u>High School Education</u></h4>

<p>Throughout the past decade the city created new programs to try to increase high school graduation rates like, universal pre-k, family supports and more middle school coursework. This has led in part to the amount of people who did not finish high school decreasing by 3.2 percent. This trend continued in 2020, with New York City Schools Chancellor Richard A. Carranza declaring that the city reached its highest high school graduation rate at 79 percent. However, the New York State Education Department did acknowledge that the increase in 2020 could also be due in part to the pandemic cancellation of Regents exams, which loosened the requirements for graduation.</p>

<h4><u>College Education</u></h4>

    </div>
<p>From 2009-2019, New Yorkers achieving college education increased across all degree levels. Chancellor Carranza said that this also appears to be increasing even more in 2020, with the rate of high school students enrolling in college reaching 63 percent. This seems promising especially during a pandemic, however this may be due in part to CUNY waiving application fees for low-income students for the first time. Even if some of this 2020 increase was due to this, the trends from 2009-2019 show that it is likely that these rates will continue to increase.</p>
